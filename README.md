## 🎯 Project Overview

This project investigates **industrial employment growth patterns** and **regional clustering** in **Yorkshire and Humber (UK)** from 2013 to 2023.
Using data from the **Business Register and Employment Survey (BRES)**, the analysis explores how employment trends differ across industrial sectors and local authorities.

The study applies **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and clustering techniques in R** to identify growth trends and regional similarities.
It aims to support **policy-making and industrial development** by revealing structural dynamics in the regional labour market.
